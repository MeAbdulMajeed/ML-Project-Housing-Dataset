# Machine Learning Project on Housing Dataset

## Introductiont
In this project, I have used the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the house price based on various features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, guest room, main road, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, prefarea, furnishingstatus.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its various features. We started by performing data analysis on the dataset as we noticed that some columns had categorical data. We used binary classification to convert this categorical data into numerical data. For example, we set yes=1 and no=0.

## Data Cleaning

After converting the categorical data into numerical data, we checked for null values and filled in the missing data. Once we had a clean dataset, we defined the model and split the data into training and testing sets. We then trained the model and tested it to evaluate its performance.

## Usage

This project can be used by anyone interested in learning about machine learning or predicting house prices based on various features. The code and dataset used in this project are available in the repository for anyone to use or modify.

To run the code, you will need to install the required dependencies and run the main Python file. You can modify the code to experiment with different models or features and see how they affect the performance of the model.
